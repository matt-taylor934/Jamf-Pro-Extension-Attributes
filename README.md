# Jamf Pro Extension Attributes

This repository contains scripts intended for use as Computer Extension Attributes in Jamf Pro.  I strongly recommend to test any and all of them thoroughly before introducing to production, as well as when any new macOS / Jamf Pro version is released to ensure they still function as intended.
